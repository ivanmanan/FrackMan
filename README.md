# FrackMan
February 2016

FrackMan is a miner who digs underground collecting oil barrels while avoiding protesters.

StudentWorld.cpp, StudentWorld.h, Actor.cpp, and Actor.h are the only files I created. All other files, images, and content had been provided by UCLA's Computer Science II class in February 2016. Big thank you to Professor Smallberg.

I utilized classes, inheritances, and polymorphism throughout the code.
The Actor files contain the objects of my code.
The StudentWorld files contain the mechanics of the gameplay.
