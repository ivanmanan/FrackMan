1. A high-level description of each of your public member functions in each of
your classes, and why you chose to define each member function in its host
class; also explain why (or why not) you decided to make each function
virtual or pure virtual. For example, “I chose to define a pure virtual version
of the blah() function in my base class because all Actors in FrackMan must
have a blah function, and each type of actor defines their own special version
of it.”
